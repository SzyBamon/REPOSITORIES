    <h2>IRAN-PAKISTAN</h2>

    <p>
      On Tuesday,
      <b
        >Iran unexpectedly carried out a missile and drone attack on Pakistani
        territory.</b
      >
      Iran said it was targeting an Iranian Sunni Muslim militant group, Jaish
      al-Adl, that has staged attacks inside Iran. Pakistan said two children
      were killed and swiftly hit back, launching missiles at Pakistani
      "terrorist hideouts" on Iran's side of the border. Iran said three women,
      two men and four children were killed.

      The flare-up has heightened tensions in a region already experiencing a
      multitude of crises. Although the area of the tit-for-tat strikes is far
      from the main theatres of fighting in the Middle East, the border is
      volatile and further incidents here could quickly escalate, for instance
      if Jaish al-Adl retaliates against Iran.

      This week saw multiple rounds of US Navy missile strikes against the
      Houthi Zaidi Shia movement in Yemen, following Houthi attacks on shipping
      in the Red Sea, a waterway crucial to world trade. The Houthis - backed by
      Iran - stepped up their attacks in November following the outbreak of the
      war in Gaza. They vowed to target "Israeli-linked" boats so long as
      Israel's offensive continued, to show solidarity with the Palestinians.

      Consequently all merchant shipping in the international waters has been
      put under threat, something considered intolerable by Western powers. The
      US and UK, backed by allies, launched the first air strikes against the
      Houthis last <i>week to try to deter them</i> - but the group has remained
      defiant.
